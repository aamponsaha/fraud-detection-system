# fraud-detection-system
This is the prototype of a system aiming to prevent fraud in Health insurance claims processing.
The authors have used sample decision tree classification rules to detect and prevent fraud in the claims processing system.
Before programming the smart contract, the authors experimented with domain-specific data to acquire benchmarked computational 
results to ascertain the level of accuracy and reliability of the discovered knowledge.

# how to test the source code
1. Open Remix- Ethereum IDE.
2. Copy the two files in the contracts folder and place them in the contracts folder in the IDE.
3. Open any of the files and click the Solidity Compiler to compile.
4. Click on Deploy & Run Transaction to test the code.

Thanks and Enjoy.
